DunedinJS is a JavaScript community in Dunedin, New Zealand.

We emerged from [CodeCraft Dunedin](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codecraft-dunedin) as a special interest group for JavaScript and its surrounding ecosystem.

GitHub organisation: https://github.com/DunedinJS
YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUlFxZtXrU1YsMpc9-52PjQ

Please raise any issues, or open pull requests with changes on any of our Github repositories. Also, feel free to contact Matthew Norrish directly at matt@mnorrish.co.nz.

We are reaching out to JavaScript New Zealand for support and advice. [Join the JavaScript New Zealand team on Slack](http://slack.javascript.org.nz) and the [#dunedin-js](https://javascriptnewzealand.slack.com/messages/dunedin-js) channel &mdash; it's an excellent way to meet JavaScript developers throughout New Zealand.
