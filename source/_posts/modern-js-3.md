This month we'll continue from where we finished the December workshop with the [DunedinJS/migrating-to-modern-js](https://github.com/DunedinJS/migrating-to-modern-js) project.

_Everything will still be at a suitable level for new-comers but it is recommended to take a look project repo and see stages 00 to 05._

### Homework:

Bring your own laptop with Git and Node.js 6.9 installed.
Follow the instructions here to install Node.js:
https://github.com/DunedinJS/dunedin-modern-javascript/blob/master/topics/common/nodejs-install.md

Also have a text editor with first-class JavaScript support -- Atom, VSCode, and Sublime Text are best.

### Part 1: Unit testing with Jest

We'll introduce basic unit tests with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

[DunedinJS/migrating-to-modern-js](https://github.com/DunedinJS/migrating-to-modern-js) stage 06

### Part 2: Convert to modern syntax

Convert the existing source code to modern syntax.
We will use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to enforce good code style and briefly introduce ES6 class syntax.

[DunedinJS/migrating-to-modern-js](https://github.com/DunedinJS/migrating-to-modern-js) stages 07 and 08

### Part 3: ???

Let's leave this open.

It would be great if anybody has something to present.
An informal question and answer session on anything JavaScript related might also be useful for many.
