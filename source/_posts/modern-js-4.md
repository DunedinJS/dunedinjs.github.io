As promised -- this month we're going all React.

React is a library for building user interfaces. It is developed by Facebook.
https://facebook.github.io/react/

Together we'll follow the EggHead.io React Fundamentals course.
https://egghead.io/courses/react-fundamentals

Those in the room with React experience will be available to answer any questions.
We'll also cover why React might be chosen for a project and make recommendations for further learning.

_Everything will be at a suitable level for new-comers with minimal JavaScript experience._

### Homework:

Bring your own laptop with Git and Node.js 6.9 installed.
Follow the instructions here to install Node.js:

Also have a text editor with first-class JavaScript support -- Atom, VSCode, and Sublime Text are best.
