A new repository which shows an example of how an existing project can be
migrated to modern JavaScript syntax, features, and technologies.

The aim is to introduce enough about each aspect so that developers can apply
the concepts to their own projects.

The application is a simple stopwatch, initially written with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/).
We gradually modernise the project by introducing [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [ESLint](http://eslint.org/), [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) among others in an approachable step-by-step format.
