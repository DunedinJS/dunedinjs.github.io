### Homework:

Bring your own laptop with Git and Node.js 6.9 installed.
Follow the instructions here to install Node.js:
https://github.com/DunedinJS/dunedin-modern-javascript/blob/master/topics/common/nodejs-install.md

Also have a text editor with first-class JavaScript support -- Atom, VSCode, and Sublime Text are best.

### Part 1: Migrating an existing app to modern JS

Take a small old-style JS app, make the source code modular, and introduce modern JS features in a pragmatic way.

### Part 2: Up and running with a React

Get up and running with a React starter project based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
_**We will continue to use this in future workshops too**_

### Part 3: Testing with Jest

An introduction to unit testing with the excellent [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) framework.
