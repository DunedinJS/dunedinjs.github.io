### Homework:

Bring your own laptop with Git and Node.js 6.9 installed.
Follow the instructions here to install Node.js:
https://github.com/DunedinJS/dunedin-modern-javascript/blob/master/topics/common/nodejs-install.md

Also have a text editor with first-class JavaScript support -- Atom, VSCode, and Sublime Text are best.

### Migrating an existing app to modern JS

Take a small old-style JS app, make the source code modular, and introduce modern JS features in a pragmatic way.
